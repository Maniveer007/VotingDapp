# ZAMA-Vote: Redefining Democracy

Welcome to **ZAMA-Vote**, where innovation meets democracy. Tired of the shortcomings of traditional voting systems? 

## Why ZAMA-Vote?

Our revolutionary platform harnesses the power of cutting-edge Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) techniques through FHEVM, providing a robust and trustworthy alternative to conventional voting methods.

## Explore the Depths of ZAMA-Vote

Let's take a deep dive into how **ZAMA-Vote** operates:

### VoteERC20

**VoteERC20** It's a special Encrypted-erc20 NFT (Non-Fungible Token ) that can only be minted by the **VotingDapp** contract. With strict control by the Election Commissioner, each voter receives a NFT, akin to a Voter ID card in traditional systems, ensuring the sanctity of the voting process.

### VotingDapp

**VotingDapp** serves as the backbone of our system, seamlessly integrating traditional voting mechanisms with ZAMA's FHEVM technology.

#### RegisterVoteRight: Empowering Voters

Before casting their votes, users must request voting rights. The Election Commissioner verifies and grants these rights, ensuring that only eligible individuals participate in the electoral process.
